# Volumetric Clouds and Ocean
Here is my first progress render the really Volumetric Clouds and ocean. However, I hadn't been able to do it because I lacked experience. But this time, to my surprise, everything worked out. Initially, my goal was only render the ocean, but thanks to someone who showed me an example of clouds realized in 2D, I finally managed to do it. 
However, yes, I still had to rewrite it.
I hope you like my result, although I admit that I took the algorithms and some functions directly from other people, but the result was still different and I still had to rewrite the code.
